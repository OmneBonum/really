<h6 style="font-weight: 900; line-height: normal;">To understand this project, you gotta
  learn about it.  But fear not, if you are reading through this, you
  are a very special person. You are an early-adopter. You are the kind of

  As for the voters who will eventually be participating as members of their
  District's Direct Legislature, it won't be necessary for them to hunker down

  who will be very nice people (maybe you?) who will answer all their questions.
