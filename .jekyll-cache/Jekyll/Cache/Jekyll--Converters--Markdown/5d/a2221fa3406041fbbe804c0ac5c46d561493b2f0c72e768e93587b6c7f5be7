I"*<p>Here it is. I’m putting it out there in the world.</p>

<p>The trick at this point is going to be to get other people on board.  Of course,
I’m still developing the idea, I’m still working on a body of explanatory literature
that will eventually be enough to fill a book, and there are still a lot of specifics
that need to be filled in.  But the rough outline of what I mean by Democracy
Straight-Up is pretty much in place.  At some point, you just gotta jump in!</p>

<p>This project started to take shape for me 30 years ago when I was in grad school. I was studying sociology.</p>

<p>I had a great English teacher when I was an undergrad–I took three courses he taught. I tapped him for a recommendation when I applied to grad schools, and he obliged, but he wrote me a letter, one line of which I will never forget: “Your pursuit of a graduate degree is laudable, but I can’t agree with your choice of sociology, which I see as a haven for mediocrities and unclear thinking.”</p>

<p>He wasn’t wrong.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding that, I entered sociology with good intentions: I felt like there was something wrong with society, and I wanted to fix it.  I suppose I could boil it down to this: with all this prosperity, why is there still so much obviously preventable suffering?</p>

<p>My focus on Direct Legislation grew out of my frustration with all of the social theory I was ingesting. I became
suspicious of any effort to improve our democracy through ideological efforts.  That’s
a nice way to put it. What I would like to say is that our go-to technique for improving
democracy in America is to make ourselves a great, big, really judgmental hammer and start pounding on people’s thick skulls. Not that I don’t have an ideology. I can get
judgmental with the best of them. I’m a human being and like anyone else I have my political opinions.
But after a while, the hammer gets heavy.  Really, really heavy.</p>

<p>So, I asked myself, if I wanted to improve democracy without changing anyone’s political beliefs how would I do it?</p>

<p>It struck me that there was a huge disconnect between the ‘will of the people,’ on the
one hand and our system of representation and legislation on the other.  So,
I started casting about for solutions. Often, the problem of representation is addressed
by shouting, “Kick the bums out!”  This places the blame on the legislators themselves. But
this always struck me as a poor solution.  There is a reason why legislators tend to
be the way they are.  It doesn’t really have much to do with their personal character.
Even people with good intentions have a hard time getting things done.  Also, as much as
people say they want to replace the congress with a better crop of people, they never do,
do they?</p>

<p>But if the legislators aren’t to blame, then are the voters to blame?  After all, they
keep voting for the bums!  So, what are the next steps if that’s your diagnosis?  You need
to run around motivating and educating people so that they make better decisions. Get
involved in the civic life of their community.  And…zzzzz….oh, sorry, just fell asleep
for a second there.</p>

<p>More to the point, what if ‘blaming the people’ is also a wrong-headed solution to the
problem?  So, it occurred to me that the solution to the disconnect between a legislative
representative and the people they represent was simply to build a connection.  A direct
connection.  Not encouragement, not education, not making sure a representative was
in touch with the voters in some vague, haphazard way, not employing opinion polls, or even, God forbid, referenda.
Just a direct link, as direct as possible, cut out all the messiness and uncertainty
in the middle.</p>

<p>Direct Legislation, I realized, was what I had happened upon, although I am hardly the first one.</p>

<p>But I soon realized that Direct Legislation needed something.  The
idea of the ‘unwashed masses’ dictating public policy on a whim fills many people
with trepidation.  I’m one of them.</p>

<p>So, I began to think of Direct Legislation as a right.  With any right comes a responsibility.
How can we be assured that when people obtain the power of direct legislation, they will use
it wisely?  Our representatives were supposed to be the ‘wise’ ones, but that system
has clearly failed in that regard.  And if we can’t sway the American people to embrace
a single ideology, if we can’t motivate them to become responsible civic actors, what
defense is there against mobocracy?</p>

<p>The answer is that with any right comes a responsibility.  Since there can’t be a litmus
test of how well-informed you are before you vote on a bill, there had better be some
other way to at least encourage careful thinking when it comes to enacting the law
of the land.  As it turns out, there is. It naturally takes the form of a Meritocratic System of Delegation. Yes, it is a mouthful, and there’s no point trying to explain it all here, when that is what this website is for!  But it is the missing piece, the other side of the coin, that makes Direct Legislation an integrated whole. It meets the
minimum requirement of keeping every empowered voter connected to the legislative body of
which they are a part, without putting any unwarranted, or ideologically driven, demands
on the individual.</p>

<p>And there we have, in brief, Democracy Straight-Up: Direct Legislation combined with
a Meritocratic System of Delegation.</p>
